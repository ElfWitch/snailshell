# 🐌 snailshell
A tiny library and [application ](#%EF%B8%8F-snailshell-standalone)for animating text in the terminal. 


![demo](demo.gif)

☝️ From [Fun Stuff example](examples/fun_stuff.rs).
(obviously looks smoother in an actual terminal)

Easily add some flair to your text RPGs or console programs.

### 👩‍🏫 Examples
___
#### Basic
```rust
use snailshell::*;

// It's dead simple.
snailprint("hello, friend :)");
```

#### Custom Fixed Duration
```rust
snailprint_d("This whole message will print in half a second regardless of the size.", 0.5);
```

#### Refresh Rate
```rust
// This is optional. Default fps is 60.
// All subsequent snailprint functions will use this fps.
set_snail_fps(30);
```
