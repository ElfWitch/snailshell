//! # snailshell
//! Tiny library for making terminal text display with pleasant RPG-style animations.
//!
//! ## Examples
//! ```
//! # use snailshell::*;
//! // basic
//! snailprint("MUDKIP used WATER GUN!");
//!
//! // custom speeds
//! snailprint_d("This fully prints in exactly one second.", 1.0);
//! snailprint_s("This prints six characters per second", 6.0);
//! ```
//!
//! ## Colored Text
//! ```
//! use snailshell::*;
//!
//! // use any library you like.
//! // Snailshell works on any type that implements display.
//! // That means any type which you can use print!(), println!(), or format!() with!
//! use crossterm::style::Stylize;
//!
//! snailprint("flamingo, oh oh ou-oh".magenta());
//!
//! ```
//!
//! ### Refresh Rate
//! You can change the refresh rate with [set_snail_fps].
//! Call it once at the beginning of your program.
//! This is entirely optional.
//!
//! Default fps is 60.
